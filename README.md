# JS-Portfolio
Week 2 assignment, making a personal portfolio page

I realize now I struggle a bit with the distinction between using block or flex (and the current code shows!).
Something I put in the CSS is preventing the hover function, but I need to trial and error it to figure out why it won't work.
I also need to drastically clean up the code in the CSS (it's horrendous right now), but I think the HTML is mostly good (slight issue with the mailto: href for my email which isn't opening my gmail as I believe it should, but I'll figure out, might be my browser settings).

I haven't had much time this week to dive back into last week classes, which is why the project is not complete yet (not to the full extent of the acceptance criteria or to what I want it to be), but I will get around to it, I am more familiar with Javascript so shouldn't struggle as much on the project and will have more time to circle back to this one!

I hope the repo name and commit comments are better this time around at least!
